## Introduction

Welcome to litrbuddy, an app for simplifying the process of digesting research literature, whether you're a college student or a seasoned researcher, litrbuddy can make your academic journey smoother and more efficient. 

You can upload research documents and research questions (RQs), and receive concise, easy-to-understand summaries of articles, including their purpose, method, findings, and how they relate to your RQ.

The app is currently set up to use *gpt-3.5-turbo* from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)

## Features

### 1. Simplified and Time-Saving Literature Summaries

litrbuddy uses AI (Large Language Models) to provide you with clear and concise summaries of research articles. These summaries are broken down into four key components:

- **Purpose**: Understand the main objectives and goals of the article.
- **Method**: Explore the research methods and techniques employed in the study.
- **Findings**: Get a grasp of the key results and discoveries.
- **Concluding Remarks**: Get the AIs opinon on how/if each article contributes to or answers your research question.

### 2. User-Friendly Interface

User-friendly Streamlit interface makes it easy to use litrbuddy. You can quickly navigate through the summaries, and if you prefer, get 'a litrature review' in a continuous body of text for a deeper dive into the article.

# Disclaimer
litrbuddy provides automated summaries generated by AI. While it is prompted to only summerize the given text(s), it can still produce inaccurate summeries.
